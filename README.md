# Fruit Classifier

## Project's Target

My machine-learning model is able to recognize the fruit type from a given image.

## How I use machine learning to solve this problem?

- I had chosen a dataset on Kaggle for this problem. It basically contains more than 90000 images of over 100 types of fruits and vegetables.
- The main machine learning algorithm that I used for this project is CNN.
- I also added a pre-trained model called InceptionV3 to improve the performance of my machine-learning model.
